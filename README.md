Miwok App
===================================

This app displays lists of vocabulary words for the user to learn the Miwok language through audio and visual cues.

Miwok language is an endangered language which is sadly on the verge of extinction.

The app is built as an effort towards preserving the endangered language. It provides English to Miwok translations of common phrases and words using audio files.

The app uses Androidâ€™s Fragments, AudioManager, AudioFocus, MediaPlayer classes. It also provides visual feedback (ripple animation) when a button is clicked.
